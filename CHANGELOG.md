### Refactor & Architecture
- Refactored server codebase to modular monolith architecture:

  - Each module contains its own `service.ts`, `handler.ts`, and `types.ts`
  - Updated all routes to use new handlers from modules
  - Created module index files for clean imports
- Deleted legacy `controllers` and `services` directories
- Separated all request/response/result models into dedicated `types.ts` files per module
- Improved type safety and maintainability
